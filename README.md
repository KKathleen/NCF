# NCF
An pytorch GPU implementation of He et al. "Neural Collaborative Filtering" at WWW'17

This code only process the Movielens 1M Dataset https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. 

Based on the paper's result, the improvement of with pre-train over without pre-train is not too significant, so this version is just the NCF with the intergration of GMF and MLP.
